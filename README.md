# Todo List REST API

This is a simple rewrite of a To-Do list REST API, following the guidelines set by https://github.com/kadcom/mda.

The primary goal of this project is to enhance my comprehension of REST APIs in Go while also gaining a basic understanding of the Onion Architecture.

There are some distinctions between this project and the mda. Instead of PostgreSQL & Chi, this project utilizes SQLite & Echo.

The choice to use SQLite and Echo stemmed from my learning process at the time of creating this project. I opted for SQLite due to its simplicity as a database, and I was exploring the functionalities of Echo.
